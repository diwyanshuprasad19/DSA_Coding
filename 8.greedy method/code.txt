No, it is not always possible to solve a greedy problem using dynamic programming (DP) and vice-versa. While both approaches are used for optimization problems, they have different problem-solving paradigms.

1. Greedy to DP
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope that these choices lead to a globally optimal solution.
Dynamic programming considers all possible solutions and uses optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems to build the final answer.
Example where Greedy Works but DP Does Not Make Sense:
Activity Selection Problem (Choosing maximum non-overlapping intervals sorted by end times).
The greedy approach picks the earliest finishing activity at each step.
A DP approach would need to track multiple possibilities, making it inefficient.
Huffman Encoding (Building a prefix-free binary tree).
The greedy approach (using a priority queue) efficiently constructs the optimal tree.
A DP approach would not work efficiently because there are no overlapping subproblems to exploit.
2. DP to Greedy
DP ensures optimality by solving subproblems and combining them, but greedy may fail if a local optimal choice does not lead to the global optimal solution.
Example where DP Works but Greedy Fails:
0/1 Knapsack Problem (Choosing items with given weights and values to maximize value under a weight constraint).

Greedy (picking the highest value-to-weight ratio item first) fails in cases where picking smaller items would yield a better total value.
DP (solving for each weight limit up to the total weight) gives the correct solution.
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

A naive greedy approach (always picking the next greater element) does not work in all cases.
DP (tracking increasing subsequences using states) works correctly.
Conclusion
If a problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, DP is the best approach.
If a problem satisfies the greedy choice property and optimal substructure, a greedy approach works.
Some problems can be solved by both approaches, but often DP is more general and works in cases where greedy fails.
