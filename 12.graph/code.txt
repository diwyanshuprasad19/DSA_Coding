Graph Algorithms and Their Use Cases



1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
When to Use: When edges have non-negative weights and the shortest path is needed from a single source.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Bellman-Ford is preferred if negative weights exist.
Floyd-Warshall is better for all-pairs shortest path.

Yes, Dijkstra’s Algorithm works on directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, provided that all edge weights are non-negative.

in negative does not work and if negative cycle also it fails as goes to tle keep runnign infinitly

2. Topological Sort
When to Use: When solving dependency-based problems (e.g., course scheduling, build dependencies).
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Other algorithms don’t work for DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) dependencies.
Topological sorting only works for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and does not apply to undirected graphs.


3. Kruskal’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
When to Use: When the graph is sparse (E ≈ V) and edges are sorted or easily sortable.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Prim’s Algorithm is better when the graph is dense (E ≈ V²).


4. Prim’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
When to Use: When the graph is dense and adjacency matrix representation is used.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Kruskal’s Algorithm is better if the graph is sparse or using an edge list.

What is spanning tree
A spanning tree can only be found in an undirected graph, not in a directed graph.


6. Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Shortest Path)
When to Use: When the graph has negative weights and requires a shortest path from a single source.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Dijkstra’s Algorithm is faster if all edges have non-negative weights.
see works for negativ cyel and then works on directed graph only if want to woirk on undirected then we need to change it to directed graph


7. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (All-Pairs Shortest Path)
When to Use: When we need shortest paths between all pairs of nodes and the graph is relatively small.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Dijkstra’s Algorithm is better for single-source shortest path.


8. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
When to Use: When solving optimization problems involving visiting nodes in an optimal order.
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
No other algorithm efficiently solves NP-hard problems like TSP.
Approximation algorithms (MST-based heuristics) are often used instead.
hamilton cycle:A Hamiltonian Cycle is a path in a graph that visits every node exactly once and returns to the starting node


9. Bipartite Graph Check
When to Use: When checking if a graph can be two-colored (used in matchmaking, job scheduling).
Why Not Use Other Alternatives?
Other algorithms don’t solve bipartiteness, except DFS/BFS, which is required for checking.
A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors since it does not contain any odd-length cycles. In bipartite graph coloring:

One set of nodes gets one color.
The other set gets a different color.
No two adjacent nodes have the same color.

any graph that has odd length cycle can never be bipartite




10.disjoint set
good for finding nodes in same graph connected or not at any given point
