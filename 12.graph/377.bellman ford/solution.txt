see we run this n-1 times because we need to 
because like in edges we have 6 edges from 0 to 6
4-5,3-4,2-3,1-2,0-1 like hence hence each iteration will update like deom 0-1 first second will 1-2 and hence 
we need at most n-1 iteration

The Bellman-Ford algorithm has a time complexity of O(V * E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph, and a space complexity of O(V), meaning it requires memory proportional to the number of vertices to store distance information. 
Explanation:
Time complexity:
The algorithm iterates through all edges V-1 times, relaxing each edge in each iteration, resulting in a total time complexity of O(V * E). 
Space complexity:
The algorithm primarily needs to store an array to keep track of the current shortest distances for each vertex, which requires space proportional to the number of vertices (V).
