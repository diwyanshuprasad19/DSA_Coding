bitwise xor:

Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares two bits and returns:

1 if the two bits are different.
0 if the two bits are the same.

Explanation:
Sure! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code in a chat-friendly format:

Code Breakdown:
1. while ((num >> bitPos) & 1)
num >> bitPos:

This right-shifts the number num by bitPos positions.
Effect: Moves the bit at position bitPos to the least significant bit (LSB) position.
(num >> bitPos) & 1:

The bitwise AND with 1 extracts the LSB of the shifted result.
Purpose: Checks if the bit at position bitPos in num is 1 or 0.
while ((num >> bitPos) & 1):

The loop continues as long as the bit at position bitPos is 1.
It increments bitPos until a 0 bit is found.
++bitPos:

Increments bitPos by 1 to move to the next bit position.
2. num |= (1 << bitPos)
1 << bitPos:

Left-shifts 1 by bitPos positions, creating a mask with only the bitPos bit set to 1.
Example: If bitPos = 3, 1 << bitPos results in 00001000 (binary).
num |= (1 << bitPos):

The bitwise OR operation sets the bit at position bitPos in num to 1.
Other bits in num remain unchanged.
Example:
If num = 1010 (binary) and 1 << 3 produces 1000:
num | 1000 = 1010 (no change if the bit was already set).
If num = 0010, num | 1000 = 1010 (the bit is set to 1).
3. --bitsToAdd
--bitsToAdd:
Decrements the bitsToAdd counter by 1.
Purpose: Tracks how many more 1 bits need to be added to num.




Remove bit:
Sure! Here's a breakdown of the code for removeSetBits and how it works:

Function Explanation: removeSetBits
cpp
Copy code
int removeSetBits(int num, int bitsToRemove) {
    while (bitsToRemove > 0) {
        num &= (num - 1);
        --bitsToRemove;
    }
    return num;
}
Key Concepts:
num &= (num - 1)

This operation is the core of the function. Here's what it does:
Subtracting 1 from a number flips all the bits starting from the rightmost 1 bit (including that 1 bit itself).
Performing num & (num - 1) clears the rightmost 1 bit in num.
Example:
If num = 1010 (binary):
num - 1 = 1001 (binary)
num & (num - 1) = 1010 & 1001 = 1000 (binary)
The rightmost 1 bit is cleared.
--bitsToRemove

Decrements the bitsToRemove counter by 1 after each iteration.
Purpose: Ensures the loop only clears the desired number of 1 bits.
while (bitsToRemove > 0)

Continues looping until the specified number of 1 bits (bitsToRemove) are cleared from num.
return num

After clearing the specified number of 1 bits, the updated num is returned.
Example Walkthrough:
Input:

num = 13 (binary: 1101)
bitsToRemove = 2
Step-by-Step Execution:

First Iteration:

num = 1101 (binary)
num - 1 = 1100 (binary)
num & (num - 1) = 1101 & 1100 = 1100 (binary)
One 1 bit cleared; bitsToRemove = 1.
Second Iteration:

num = 1100 (binary)
num - 1 = 1011 (binary)
num & (num - 1) = 1100 & 1011 = 1000 (binary)
Another 1 bit cleared; bitsToRemove = 0.
Output:

num = 1000 (binary), which is 8 in decimal.

code:
class Solution {
public:
    int countSetBits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num) {
            count += num & 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    int addSetBits(int num, int bitsToAdd) {
        int bitPos = 0;
        while (bitsToAdd > 0) {
            while ((num >> bitPos) & 1) ++bitPos;
            num |= (1 << bitPos);
            --bitsToAdd;
        }
        return num;
    }

    int removeSetBits(int num, int bitsToRemove) {
        while (bitsToRemove > 0) {
            num &= (num - 1);
            --bitsToRemove;
        }
        return num;
    }
    
    int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        int setBitsNum1 = countSetBits(num1);
        int setBitsNum2 = countSetBits(num2);

        if (setBitsNum1 == setBitsNum2) return num1;
        if (setBitsNum1 < setBitsNum2) return addSetBits(num1, setBitsNum2 - setBitsNum1);
        return removeSetBits(num1, setBitsNum1 - setBitsNum2);
    }
};
