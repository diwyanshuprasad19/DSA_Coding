code:
Here is the C++ code for generating permutations using backtracking:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& ans, int idx) {
    // Base Case: If we reach the end, store the current permutation
    if (idx == nums.size()) {
        ans.push_back(nums); // Store the current permutation
        return;
    }

    // Try swapping each element with the current index
    for (int i = idx; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        swap(nums[i], nums[idx]);  // Swap to make a choice
        solve(nums, ans, idx + 1); // Recur with the new choice
        swap(nums[i], nums[idx]);  // Undo choice (backtrack)
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3}; // Input list
    vector<vector<int>> ans;      // To store all permutations
    solve(nums, ans, 0);

    // Print all permutations
    cout << "All permutations:\n";
    for (const auto& perm : ans) {
        for (int num : perm) {
            cout << num << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Real-Time Example: Understanding Backtracking in Layman's Terms
Scenario: Arranging 3 Friends (A, B, and C) in Different Orders
Imagine you have 3 friends (A, B, and C), and you want to find all possible ways they can sit in a row.

At the start, the order is [A, B, C].
You put A in the first seat, then explore placing B or C in the second seat.
Once you have a full arrangement (like [A, B, C]), you record it.
Then you backtrack (undo the last step) to try [A, C, B].
Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Let's visualize what happens as we generate permutations for [1, 2, 3]:

Step	Current List	What Happens?
Start	[1, 2, 3]	Start exploring
Swap 1 with 1	[1, 2, 3]	No change, move to next position
Swap 2 with 2	[1, 2, 3]	No change, move to next position
Swap 3 with 3	[1, 2, 3]	A complete arrangement found!
Backtrack	[1, 2, 3]	Undo last step (C with C)
Swap 2 with 3	[1, 3, 2]	Try a new arrangement
Swap 2 with 2	[1, 3, 2]	A new valid arrangement found!
Backtrack	[1, 2, 3]	Undo previous swap, try new swaps
Final Output: All Possible Orders

1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 2 1
3 1 2
Key Takeaways
Swap and recurse: Try placing each number at the current position.
Base case: When idx == nums.size(), store the permutation.
Undo swaps (backtracking): Restore the original state before moving forward.

Time and space complexity:
Time and Space Complexity Analysis for the C++ Backtracking Algorithm
Time Complexity
The algorithm generates all permutations of an array of size 
𝑛
n, and each permutation requires 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) operations to be stored.

Number of permutations: Since we are generating all permutations, the number of possible permutations of an array of size 
𝑛
n is:

𝑛
!
(
Factorial of 
𝑛
)
n!(Factorial of n)
Operations per permutation: Each permutation is created by swapping elements, and swapping takes constant time 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1). However, to generate all permutations, we perform recursive calls and loop over 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) choices at each step.

Total recursive calls: At each level of recursion, we make 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) calls (because we iterate from idx to n-1), leading to a tree structure of depth 
𝑛
n. The recursion tree has at most 
𝑂
(
𝑛
!
)
O(n!) leaves.

Thus, the total time complexity is:

𝑂
(
𝑛
⋅
𝑛
!
)
=
𝑂
(
𝑛
!
)
O(n⋅n!)=O(n!)
since 
𝑛
n is negligible compared to 
𝑛
!
n!.

Space Complexity
There are two main contributors to space usage:

Recursive Call Stack:

The recursion depth goes up to 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) because we make recursive calls until we reach idx == n. So, the maximum function call stack depth is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n).
Storage for Permutations:

We store all 
𝑛
!
n! permutations, and each permutation is a list of size 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), leading to:
𝑂
(
𝑛
⋅
𝑛
!
)
O(n⋅n!)
for storing results.
