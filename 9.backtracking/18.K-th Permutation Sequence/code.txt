        vector<int>ans;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)

        }
        ans.push_back(n);
        //rememmber use 0 based indexing.
        k=k-1;
        string s="";
        while(true)
        {
            s=s+to_string(ans[k/fact]);
            ans.erase(ans.begin()+k/fact);
            if(ans.size()==0)
                break;
            k=k%fact;
            fact=fact/ans.size();
        }

Time and compelxity:
Factorial Calculation:

The first loop calculates the factorial of n-1 and stores the numbers from 1 to n in the ans vector. This loop runs O(n) times, where n is the number of elements. So, the time complexity for this part is O(n).
Main Loop:

The main loop runs as long as there are elements left in the ans vector. In each iteration:
It computes k/fact, which gives the index of the element to be selected.
It appends the selected element to the result string s.
It removes the selected element from the ans vector, which takes O(n) time for the worst case (since erase takes linear time in the worst case).
It updates k and reduces fact by dividing it by the current size of ans.
The loop runs n times (one for each digit in the permutation). In each iteration:

The erase operation takes O(n) time, as it removes one element from the vector and shifts the remaining elements.
Thus, the total time complexity for the loop is O(n^2) due to the erase operation.
Overall Time Complexity:

The initial loop runs in O(n) time, and the main loop runs in O(n^2) time due to the erase operation.
So, the total time complexity is O(n^2).
Space Complexity:
Space for ans vector:

The ans vector stores the numbers from 1 to n. It requires O(n) space.
Space for Result String s:

The result string s will eventually hold n characters (the digits of the permutation), so it also requires O(n) space.
Other Variables:

The other variables such as fact, k, and the loop variables take constant space, so their contribution to space complexity is O(1).
Overall Space Complexity:

The overall space complexity is the sum of the space for ans and the result string s, which is O(n).
Summary:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (due to the erase operation inside the main loop).
Space Complexity: O(n) (for the ans vector and the result string s).
