Code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Structure for a binary tree node
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node *left, *right;
};

// Function to return the bottom view of the binary tree
vector<int> bottomView(Node *root)
{
    vector<int> ans;
    queue<pair<Node *, int>> q;
    map<int, int> m; // Stores {vertical_level, node_value}

    q.push({root, 0});

    while (!q.empty())
    {

        q.pop();
        Node *curr = i.first;
        int vertical = i.second;

TIme and space Complexity:
Time Complexity Analysis:
BFS Traversal (Queue Operations)

Each node is enqueued and dequeued once → 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N)
Insertion into map<int, int>

Each entry operation takes 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑁
)
O(logN).
Since each node is inserted once, total map operations take 
𝑂
(
𝑁
log
⁡
𝑁
)
O(NlogN).
Extracting Values from the Map

Iterating through the map → 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N).
Total Time Complexity:
𝑂
(
𝑁
log
⁡
𝑁
)
O(NlogN)
(Due to map insertions)

Space Complexity Analysis:
Queue Storage:

In the worst case (for a skewed tree), queue stores up to 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N) elements.
Map Storage:

The map holds at most 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N) key-value pairs (one for each vertical level).
Result Vector Storage (ans):

Stores 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N) elements.
Total Space Complexity:
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
O(N)
(For the queue, map, and vector)

Final Complexity Summary:
Time Complexity:
