Time Complexity: O(N + M)
Auxiliary Space: O(N + M)

Sure! Let’s go through the entire process of merging two binary max heaps step by step, including tree diagrams for each step. We’ll use the same sample data:

Heap 1: [9, 8, 7, 5]

Heap 2: [10, 6, 4, 2]

Step 1: Combine the Two Heaps
Combine the two arrays into one:

Copy
Combined Array: [9, 8, 7, 5, 10, 6, 4, 2]
Tree Representation of Combined Array:
Copy
        9
       /  \
      8    7
     / \   / \
    5  10 6   4
   /
  2
Step 2: Heapify the Combined Array
We start heapifying from the last non-leaf node and move upward. The last non-leaf node is at index 3 (value = 5).

Step 2.1: Heapify Index 3 (Value = 5)
Compare the value at index 3 (5) with its children:

Left child: Index 7, value = 2

Right child: Index 8 (out of bounds)

Since 5 is greater than 2, no swap is needed.

Tree Representation (No Change):
Copy
        9
       /  \
      8    7
     / \   / \
    5  10 6   4
   /
  2
Step 2.2: Heapify Index 2 (Value = 7)
Compare the value at index 2 (7) with its children:

Left child: Index 5, value = 6

Right child: Index 6, value = 4

Since 7 is greater than both 6 and 4, no swap is needed.

Tree Representation (No Change):
Copy
        9
       /  \
      8    7
     / \   / \
    5  10 6   4
   /
  2
Step 2.3: Heapify Index 1 (Value = 8)
Compare the value at index 1 (8) with its children:

Left child: Index 3, value = 5

Right child: Index 4, value = 10

Since 10 (right child) is greater than 8, we swap them.

Updated Array After Swap:
Copy
Index: 0   1   2  3  4  5  6  7
Value: 9, 10, 7, 5, 8, 6, 4, 2
Tree Representation After Swap:
Copy
        9
       /  \
      10   7
     / \   / \
    5   8 6   4
   /
  2
Step 2.4: Heapify Index 0 (Value = 9)
Compare the value at index 0 (9) with its children:

Left child: Index 1, value = 10

Right child: Index 2, value = 7

Since 10 (left child) is greater than 9, we swap them.

Updated Array After Swap:
Copy
Index: 0   1   2  3  4  5  6  7
Value: 10, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 4, 2
Tree Representation After Swap:
Copy
        10
       /  \
      9     7
     / \   / \
    5   8 6   4
   /
  2
Final Max Heap
The final combined and heapified array is:

Copy
Index: 0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Value: 10, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 4, 2
Tree Representation of Final Max Heap:
Copy
        10
       /  \
      9     7
     / \   / \
    5   8 6   4

Summary of Steps
Combined the two heaps into a single array.

Heapified the combined array starting from the last non-leaf node:

Heapified index 3 (no change).

Heapified index 2 (no change).

Heapified index 1 (swapped 8 and 10).

Heapified index 0 (swapped 9 and 10).

The final tree satisfies the max-heap property.

now tell how time compelxity comes n+m
The time complexity of merging two binary max heaps is O(n + m), where:

𝑛
n is the size of the first heap.

𝑚
m is the size of the second heap.

Let’s break down why this is the case step by step.

Steps in Merging Two Binary Max Heaps
Combine the two heaps:

Concatenate the two arrays representing the heaps into a single array.

This operation takes O(1) time because it’s just appending one array to another.

Heapify the combined array:

Starting from the last non-leaf node, perform the max-heapify operation to ensure the combined array satisfies the max-heap property.

This is where the O(n + m) complexity comes from.

Why Heapify Takes O(n + m) Time
Number of Non-Leaf Nodes:

In a binary heap, the number of non-leaf nodes is approximately half the total number of nodes.

For a combined heap of size 
𝑛
+
𝑚
n+m, the number of non-leaf nodes is roughly 
𝑛
+
𝑚
2
2
n+m
​
 .

Heapify Operation:

The max-heapify operation takes O(log k) time for a subtree of size 
𝑘
k.

However, in practice, when heapifying the entire array, the total time complexity is O(n + m) because:

Most of the subtrees being heapified are small.

The work done at each level of the heap decreases exponentially as you move up the tree.

Total Work:

The total work done by max-heapify across all non-leaf nodes is proportional to the total number of nodes, 
𝑛
+
𝑚
n+m.

This is because the work done at each level of the heap is balanced by the number of nodes at that level.

Mathematical Explanation
Height of the Heap:

The height of a binary heap with 
𝑁
N nodes is 
log
⁡
𝑁
logN.

For the combined heap, the height is 
log
⁡
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
log(n+m).

Work at Each Level:

At level 
ℎ
h, there are 
2
ℎ
2 
h
  nodes, and each node requires 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
−
ℎ
)
O(log(n+m)−h) work to heapify.

The total work is the sum of work at all levels:

Total Work
=
∑
ℎ
=
0
log
⁡
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
2
ℎ
⋅
𝑂
(
log
⁡
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
−
ℎ
)
Total Work= 
h=0
∑
log(n+m)
​
 2 
h
 ⋅O(log(n+m)−h)
This sum simplifies to O(n + m).

Example with n = 4 and m = 4
Let’s use the example from earlier:

Heap 1: [9, 8, 7, 5] (size 
𝑛
=
4
n=4)

Heap 2: [10, 6, 4, 2] (size 
𝑚
=
4
m=4)

Combined heap size: 
𝑛
+
𝑚
=
8
n+m=8

Combine the Heaps:

Takes O(1) time.

Heapify the Combined Heap:

Number of non-leaf nodes: 
8
2
=
4
2
8
​
 =4.

Each max-heapify operation takes O(log 8) = O(3) time in the worst case.

Total time: 
4
⋅
𝑂
(
3
)
=
𝑂
(
12
)
4⋅O(3)=O(12), which is still O(n + m).

Conclusion
The time complexity of merging two binary max heaps is O(n + m) because:

Combining the heaps takes O(1) time.

Heapifying the combined heap takes O(n + m) time due to the balanced work done at each level of the heap.

This makes the overall process efficient for merging two heaps. Let me know if you need further clarification!
